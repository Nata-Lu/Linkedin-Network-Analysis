# LinkedIn Network Growth Strategy: B2B Outreach Analysis and Insights

## Project Context

**Client Profile:** A B2B service provider working across multiple industrial sectors with a focus on international expansion.  
**Platform:** LinkedIn  
**Objective:** Analyze and optimize the client‚Äôs LinkedIn network growth to guide strategic outreach and content marketing.

In early 2024, a LinkedIn-based campaign was launched to develop visibility and reach within key industries. This project evaluates the results of that campaign and helps define data-informed goals for the next outreach phase.

## Project Goal

The objective is to:
- Assess the structure and evolution of the LinkedIn network
- Evaluate the success of 2024 outreach efforts (especially in Focus Industry 2)
- Derive actionable recommendations for continued network growth, particularly in Focus Industry 3

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on two complementary datasets:
- **LinkedIn Connections Export** ‚Äì downloaded directly from the profile, including full metadata
- **Evaboot Export** ‚Äì scraped public LinkedIn data enriched with company-level info

‚ö†Ô∏è Original data is not shared to protect client confidentiality. An anonymized version is included for reproducibility.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Full names         | Replaced with `Person_ID`                                |
| Company names      | Mapped to `Company_XXX` with Freelance consolidated      |
| Industries         | Mapped to LinkedIn's hierarchy + aggregated by theme     |
| Positions          | Mapped to broad functions (e.g. Management, Sales, HR)   |

The dataset included in this repo complies with GDPR and ethical data publication standards.

## Key Results

### 2024 Campaign Results

- **+36% growth** in 2024 (network grew from ~410 to 557)
- **Main focus:** Focus Industry 2  
- **Target geographies:** North America and Africa  
- **Success:** Significant increase in target audience presence

### Lessons Learned

1. **Account Depth Is Shallow**  
   ‚Üí Most accounts have only one contact. Only a few accounts had 2+ connections.

2. **Targeted Companies Are Large**  
   ‚Üí Reaching multiple decision-makers per account is key, especially in large enterprises.

3. **Roles Reached:**  
   ‚Üí Mostly Management, followed by Engineering and Operations  
   ‚Üí Procurement, Marketing, and Communications underrepresented

4. **Next Steps for Focus Industry 3:**  
   ‚Üí Current presence is minimal (15 contacts in 15 companies)  
   ‚Üí Focus on companies with 50‚Äì5,000 employees  
   ‚Üí Target Business Development, Procurement, and Management roles
